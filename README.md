marble-maze
===========
Project code for a Stellaris Launchpad powered marble maze.

This repo contains two projects, one for the transmitter (hand held) launchpad
and one for the receiver (attached to the marble maze).  Assuming TI doesn't
change the format or file structure used for the TivaWare releases, you should
be able to just copy the maze_receiver and maze_transmitter directories
straight into the corresponding location of the TivaWare installation.

In its current state, I've only verified that the project builds with CCS.  It
should also build with all of the other Tiva supported IDEs, including command
line builds via makefile, but I haven't gone through the effort to verify this
yet.
